# Balance a Sphere Using Your Phone
Simple demonstration which enables you to control 3D elements using your mobile phone or tablet, the live simulation becomes available at a web endpoint of your choice.
It mimics the movements you apply to your mobile device and challenges you to keep a sphere balanced on a horizontal plane.
Rudimentary physics and collision detection are used to simulate the interaction of the involved elements.

This small project represents my first contact with both WebGL and WebSockets.
